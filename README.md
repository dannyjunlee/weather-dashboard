# Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## User Story

The USER will be a traveler who wants to see near-term weather data for a city. The USER will be able to look at weather for multiple cities and save their search.


## Acceptance Criteria

I am done when the weather dashboard has:

- A nice layout similar to the demo

- When I search using the form input, I am presented with the weather conditions for that city, including current and 5-day forecast

- That city is saved and added to search history (appended as searchable list item beneath search button)

- When I click on the city through search history, I am presented with that information again
